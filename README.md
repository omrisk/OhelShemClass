## Introduction to Angular 2

During a community outreach sponsered by the Academic College of Tel-Aviv we created and gave an introductory class to 10th grade high-school students at "Ohel-Shem" high-school.
The lessons are based off the [NG2 book](https://www.ng-book.com/2/), which is a supperb source of knowledge on the subject.
